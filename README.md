# Tyre Pressure Monitoring System 🚗💡

This is a simulation of a Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) that alerts users when tyre pressure falls below a certain threshold. This project was originally built as a team project during my B.Tech at Presidency University. This repository is a solo rebuild of the core concept, showcasing my understanding and contribution.

## 🔍 Overview

- Continuously monitors tyre pressure
- Alerts user when pressure drops below safe level
- Designed for safety and real-time feedback

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (for simulation)
- Arduino (used in the original hardware prototype)
- Sensors: Pressure sensor (in original)
- Serial Communication

## 👩‍💻 My Contribution

- Wrote logic to simulate and monitor sensor data
- Helped integrate alert system using buzzer & LED indicators
- Worked on
